# Fuddle: A Django-Based Food Sharing Platform  

🍽️ **Reduce Food Waste. Share the Joy of Home-Cooked Meals.**  

## 📌 About  
After witnessing significant food waste in offices and households, I was inspired to create **Fuddle**—a Django-based web application that connects surplus food providers with local buyers.  

### 📊 The Problem  
- **50 kg** of food per person is wasted every year in Indian households.  
- **40%** of food produced in India (worth **₹92,000 crores**) goes to waste annually.  
- Meanwhile, millions struggle with hunger, and many bachelors crave homemade food ("*maa ka khana*").  

### 💡 The Solution  
Fuddle bridges the gap by allowing users to:  
✅ **List surplus food** (home-cooked meals, office leftovers, or after a wedding leftover surplus food etc.)  
✅ **Discover nearby food listings** in real-time  
✅ **Reduce waste** while helping others enjoy affordable, homemade meals  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Secure Authentication** – User registration & login with Django  
✔ **Real-Time Listings** – Dynamic food posts with filters (cuisine, price)  
✔ **Responsive UI** – Built with **Tailwind CSS** for seamless mobile & desktop experience  
✔ **Reviews & Ratings** – Build trust within the community  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database:** SQLite (can be scaled to PostgreSQL)  

## 🌟 Why Fuddle?  
- **Fights food waste** at a grassroots level  
- **Supports local communities** by making food accessible  
- **Encourages home cooking** & reduces reliance on packaged food
